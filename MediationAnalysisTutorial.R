# In my case the microbe will be mediated by the HPLC data to produce a change in the behavioral score.

# Not great for small sample sizes.
# Three sets of regression: X->Y, X->M, X + M -> Y

# Both mediation and moderation assume that there is little to no measurement error in the mediator/moderator variable and that the DV did not CAUSE the mediator/moderator. 
# We kind of have replicates for this reason
# We know that behaviors do not cause changes in chemical concentrations
# If mediator error is likely to be high, researchers should collect multiple indicators of the construct and use SEM to estimate latent variables. 
# TODO Consider the construction of a latent variable from the HPLC measurements

# then we call it partial mediation
# The next goal is to see if this is statistically significant

# 2) Bootstrapping


# TODO How do we work out if X mediates M or M mediates X?

# Can be used in logistic regression as well
# Consider structural equation modeling if it can't be done in a small set of regressions

# TODO What about mediation analyses in machine learning approaches

# TODO How do you manage with bacteria, etc. nested within cage?

# Will need to do the subsetting by datasets before here?
# IV would be more like stress or diet (it is invidual)
# IV to metabolite
# metabolite to bacteria
# metabolite or bacteria to behavior
# The bacteria are grouped
# Many many hypotheses to correct for.
# TODO Find out how this was done in the pig study
# mma package may be helpful here.
# Is there a way I can bypass the nesting of the bacteria?
# If you consider the bacteria as just one mediator that works on the metabolite
# data to influence the behavior, it may be contained within that mouse.
